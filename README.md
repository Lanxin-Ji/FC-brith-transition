# FC-brith-transition

This project includes Matlab and R code used in the manuscript entitled "Trajectories of human brain functional connectome maturation across the birth transition"

The script "FC_Harmonization.R" was used to perform long-combat for harmonization across data aquired with different MRI sequence and MRI conditions. This script also includes the regression analysis and visulization for gloobal-level FC. Figure 1D, Figure 3B and D, and Figure 4 was generated with this script.

Scripts under the folder "figure3_networksubplots" was used in network-level FC analysis, including harmonization, regression, and visulization. Figure 2 was generated with scripts under this folder.
